This project is from social network practical work it involves simulating Schelling algorithm with networkx and matplotlib with given threshold of neighbors. Extended version of this project involves adding of real-world network simulation and state display after each iteration in animated form. Currently tuning parameters added are threshold neighbour value and iterational jumps to be performed.
