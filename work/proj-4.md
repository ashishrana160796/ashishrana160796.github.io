This chatbot is based on deep learning sequence-to-sequence model and is trained on multiple datasets for more consistent answers i.e. giving more human like behavior to it. It is part of bigger DeepVisionTool which compiles all the basics of deep learning and uses tensorflow for implementation. Currently, we are working on efficiency of  NLP Chatbot, proper documentation and system engineering of DeepVisionTool. By December end plan is to complete this DeepVisionTool project along with a functional website.
