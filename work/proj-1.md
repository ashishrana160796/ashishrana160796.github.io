Active contributor at Checker Framework tool and type tools organization. Added manual updates, annotated libraries and raised issues for this tool. With nullness type sytem conducted several case-studies like Gson library, different OpenJDK-8 libraries, partially annotated aimacode-java.Also, have created Determinism Type System for making the program deterministic in nature eliminating flaky tests. Currently working on enhancing capabilities of above system, resolving & raising issues and providing newer annotated libraries with nullness annotations. Future works involves studing different tools in typetools organization and studying newer type sytems. Learning never stops with this incredibly powerful tool.
