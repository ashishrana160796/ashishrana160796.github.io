This project involves comparitive study of Optimization Algorithms applied on nature inspired benchmark functions which will lead to optimization of multi-dimensional chromosome. Multidimensional chromosome accomodating fitness functions are hardcoded into it. Tuning of parameters are allowed for all algorithms. Best chromosome is recorded after iterative process and graph gui is plotted. Currently working on adding Java implementations of newer algorithms and also these algorithms are implemented in python for which GUI implementaion work is going on.
